            While we sometimes use more or less than this, if you&apos;re
            comfortable with the above you&apos;re sure to be a good fit.
          </p>
          <p>
            The app currently supports viewing and creating Users and Calls.
            Throughout the challenge, it&apos;s important to take in the
            conventions and patterns used in the existing codebase and try to
            adopt them as you make changes; your frontend solution should aim to
            use existing components, for example. We aim to work as a unified
            team, and this is reflected in our code. We want to see your ability
            to work within this environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you believe there is a good case for a new piece of tech or a
            package, however, feel free to use it - but also be ready to justify
            it!

          <h2 className="text-xl pt-5">Your Task</h2>
          <p>
            Our Stats page, seen in the navigation above, is very empty. Your
            task is to add some stats, detailed below.
          </p>
          <p>
            The imaginary users of this site would love to be able to see
            insights into their usage.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-1 mb-5">
            <li>
              The stats page should only include calls for the current day.
            </li>
            <li>
              Show the number of calls made each hour of the working day, from 9
              AM to 5 PM.
            </li>
            <li>
              Rank the hours based on the number of calls. In the case of a tie,
              give a higher rank to the earlier hour.
            </li>
            <li>
              For each hour of the day, show the user who placed the highest
              number of calls.
            </li>
            <li>
              Display this information in a table. Ensure the table is
              consistent with the current design.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>Secondly, display some additional summary stats, including:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-1 mb-5">
            <li>The date on which the most calls occurred.</li>
            <li>The average number of calls per day.</li>
            <li>The average number of calls per user.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These stats should appear above the table on the stats page. Try to
            align the stats to the current design. Existing components are your
            friend!
          </p>
